# MySensor

NOTE:
Adafruit DHT Library is used when DHT-22 Temperature Sensor is used. 
The library supplied by MySensors.org does not support the DHT-22.

The MySensors Nodes here are tested and fully functioning.  The code provided here is extensive and found nowhere else.  The
research, design and implementation of each node has been tested in daily use. The examples found elsewhere are incomplete and untested. The code found here is a complete solution, no partial code, no deceptive code, just plain easy Arduino code that you can customize or use as is.
